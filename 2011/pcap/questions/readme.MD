| Number        | Question      |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| 1(a) | What was the complete URI of the original web request that led to the client being compromised? |
| 1(b) | What file type was requested in the final web request to the malicious server? (Answer a, b, c ,d or e) <ul><li>a. windows executable</li><li>b. javascript</li><li>c. pdf</li><li>d.word document</li><li>e. gif | 
| 1(c) | What was the complete URI of the original web request that led to the client being compromised? | 
| 1(d) | What is the number of the first frame that indicates that the client has been compromised? |
| 1(e) | At one point, the malicious server sends a malicious file to the client. What type of file is ? (Answer a, b, c ,d or e) <ul><li>a. windows executable</li><li>b. javascript</li><li>c. pdf</li><li>d. word document</li><li>e. gif</li></ul> |
| 1(f) | What is the sha1 hash of the malicious file? |
| 1(g) | What vulnerable software is exploited (in the following format, ff3.5, ff3.6, Word2010, ie7, Safari2, Chrome2, AdobeReader, ie9)? |
| 1(h) | When the capture ends, is the client still connected to the malicious attacker? Answer either "yes" or "no". |
| 1(i) | Can you give the correspondingCVE security bulletin that covers the vulnerability here that was exploited (answer in form of CVE-$year-$number)? |
| 1(j) |  From the capture, it is clear that the attacker gets a certain form of access (i.e. the interface), what (type of) access does the attacker "get" on the client? |

| 2(a) | What is the frame that indicates the something strange might be going on? |
| 2(b) | What tool is generating this traffic? |
| 2(c) | What does this frame constitute the beginning of? (Answer a,b,c,d or e) <ul><li>a. TCP Scan</li><li>b. Ack Scan</li><li>c. Xmas Scan</li><li>d. Ping Scan</li><li>e. Syn Flood</li></ul> | 8 | 1 |
| 2(d) | The 'miscreant' then runs two scans beginning just after six minutes and 24 minutes into the trace, however, these traces weren't to his/her liking as they were too slow. On the following scans, a switch was removed from the command to improve the speed, what was this switch (just the letters, case-sensitive)?  |
| 2(e) | What switch was added to the final scan (case-sensitive)? |
| #### | #### | #### | #### |
| 3(a) | What type of ICMP traffic is this? (Answer a, b, c ,d or e) <ul><li>a. Echo request/reply</li><li>b. OS Mapping</li><li>c. Covert Channel</li><li>d. Inverse Mapping</li><li>e. Route Redirect</li></ul> |
| 3(b) | What is the number of the first frame that indicates that something funny might be going on? |
| 3(c) | What tool generated this 'malicious' traffic? |
| 3(d) | What is the application layer protocol that is hidden within the ICMP traffic (i.e. the payload)? |
| 3(e) | What is the 'true' destination of the ICMP traffic generated from 192.168.5.208? |
| 3(f) | What is the session identifier for each packet (answer in hex (2 bytes), i.e inf the format of 1111)? |
