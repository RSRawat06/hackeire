HackEire Fun
============

The questions in this section are intended to be a bit of fun and provide some light-hearted relief (from some of the stuff) so that everyone got some points :) Despite what some people thought, HackEire was intended to be fun and open to everyone, regardless of l33tness, whilst also pushing those who are more skilled.

The intention in the social networking section was obviously to show how easy it is to leak information through social networking sites.
