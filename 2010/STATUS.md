2011	
========

Everything from 2011, other than the following challenges 

- The EFS challenge
- The modified MS-08067 exploit
- The SQL vulnerability that was completely unnoticed
- The hidden SMB stuff that no one spotted
- The network devices with default login/password combination that also went mostly unnoticed

are in this repository.

Note: We screwed up this year with the challenges over wifi but a wired switch and extra time made up for it (I think).
